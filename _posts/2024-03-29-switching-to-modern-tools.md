title: Switching to Modern Tools
layout: post

In the past, I used to tinker with static HTML pages. Recently, I decided to step up and embrace more powerful tools like **Jekyll** and **GitHub Pages**.

Jekyll allows me to write in Markdown, organize posts, and generate a full site with minimal effort. Combined with GitHub Pages, my site is hosted for free and updates automatically from version control.

This upgrade not only improves my workflow but also makes the site easier to maintain and extend in the future. I'm looking forward to using it to its full potential!
