Hello and welcome! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts, projects, and lessons learned as I dive deeper into Linux, open source, and software development in general.

This blog will serve as my digital journal â€” a place to document challenges, solutions, experiments, and ideas. Whether it's configuring a tool, deploying a project, or just thinking aloud, you'll find it here.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something useful!
